## Hey, wellcome 👋

Squash was founded in **July 10th, 2021** by [**Kauã Vitório**](https://www.kauavitorio.com) and your CEOs were [Matheus Souza](https://github.com/Theus03), [Yuri Dantas](https://github.com/YDangg) and [Pedro Morato](https://github.com/pedrohmmf), with the aim of being an online services platform, distributing, hosting system, cloud storage, link shortener and between others. The initial idea was that Squash was just a social network of everyday publications, however, as the application was developed, new ideas were emerging, and thus becoming the current Squash.

### 🎆 **Our Family**

Our family is nothing less than our employees❣️, there is no employee less important than another for us, everyone has their importance, without teamwork, Squash would not exist.
